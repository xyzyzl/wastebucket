Think of each permutation mapping as a graph. Let $a \rightarrow b$ be an edge if $P_a=b$. It's clear that the minimum value of $k$ s.t $C_{P^k_x} = C_x$ for some $x$ would be the smallest value where the node $kx$ away from the current node has the same color as the current node for all nonnegative integers $x$. As this is the minimum such $k$, it follows that $k | n$. Thus, we can loop over all divisors of $n$ and check if it satisfies the condition. \\
The mistake I made was that I did not remember to check visited for the \textit{current} node, but rather checked it on the \textit{next} node. Thus, the next iteration, it would see that the node was "visited" when it really was not, and break. Thus, all of my answers were just 1.

This was actually extremely simple and I don't know why I didn't get it.\\
When I found inversions with the algorithm, for each index $i$, it counted the number of elements $j < i$ that had $a_j < a_i$ using a BIT. Then, it subtracted that value from $i$. \\
So we can find the number inversions for all indices $i$ of a specific value. And that's all we really want. From there we can find the number of inversions solely comprising values $\le x \forall x$.
