\begin{problem}[APMO 2004/2]
	27. Let $O$ be the circumcenter and $H$ the orthocenter of an acute triangle $ABC$. Prove that the area of one of the triangles $AOH, BOH, $ and $COH$ is equal to the sum of the areas of the other two.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
	Because the base of each of the triangles is equal, it suffices to prove that the heights of the triangles from $OH$ satisfy this property. For simplicity, we claim that $[AOH] = [BOH] + [COH]$; the other directions can be proven similarly.

	It is well known that $O, G, H$ are collinear on the Euler Line. Note that we can make the base any line that passes through $G$, including the one $t$ that is parallel to $BC$. Let the median from $A$ intersect $\overline{BC}$ at $M$. Then $AG = 2GM$, so the height from $A$ to $t$ is twice the height from $B$ to $t$, which is equal to the height from $C$ to $t$ as $t || BC$. Hence, the height from $A$ to $t$ is equal to the sum of the height from $B$ to $t$ and the height from $C$ to $t$, which completes the proof.
\end{solution}
